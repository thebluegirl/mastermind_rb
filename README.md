# mastermind_rb

This [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind) is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

You can play as either the encoder, who makes a code of four unique colours, or the decoder, who must correctly guess what the code composed of four unique colours are.

When playing as the decoder, you get attempts at breaking the code made by the computer. You'll also get feedback after every guess. You'll be told if you have won, lost, or receive feedback on how good your attempt was. This feedback will be provided in form of 4 numbers, one for each colour you guessed.

Here is what each number represents:
    * 2: A correct colour in the correct space.
    * 1: A colour that is part of the code, but not in the correct space
    * 0: A colour that is not a part of the code
Note that the numbers are always shown in descending order and thus, the order they're displayed in is not necessarily indicative of the order that the colours are in.

Good luck, and have fun!
